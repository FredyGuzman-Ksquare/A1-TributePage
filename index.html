          <dl>
            <dt><h2>Optics</h2></dt>
            <dd>- He identified light as the source of colour sensation</dd>
            <dd>- Isaac Newton famously determined that white light was a mix of colours which can be separated into its component parts with a prism.</dd>
            <dd>- Newton was able to counter the then held believe that light is simple and homogeneous; and prove that it is complex and heterogeneous.</dd>
            <dd>- Newton developed his Theory of Colour which is considered his most important contribution to optics.</dd>

            <dt><h2>Gravity</h2></dt>
            <dd>- Newton first compiled his three laws of motion, inertia, F = ma and action-reaction, in his 1687 work Principia. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces.</dd>
            <dd>- They laid the foundation of classical mechanics due to which it is also widely known as Newtonian mechanics.</dd>
            <dd>- Classical mechanics describes the motion of bodies under the influence of a system of forces and, since Newton, has remained a principal field of study in mathematics as well as physics.</dd>
            <dd>-  Newton formulated his law of universal gravitation which states that any two bodies in the universe attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</dd>
            <dd>-  With his theory of calculus and laws of motion and universal gravitation, Newton provided a revolutionary new mathematical description of the Universe. Apart from other things, he combined his laws to explain Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.</dd>
           
            <dt><h2>Calculus and Mathematics</h2></dt>
            <dd>- Isaac Newton is credited with discovering the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any rational exponent, in 1665. It remains to be used extensively in mathematics. Apart from the binomial theorem, Newton’s contributions to mathematics include discovery of Newton’s identities</dd>
            <dd>- In 1665, Newton began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus, the mathematical study of change. Calculus gave mathematicians for the first time a powerful form of analysis to find the slopes of curves and areas under curves.</dd>
